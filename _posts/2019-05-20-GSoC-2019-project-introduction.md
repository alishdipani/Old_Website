Google Summer of Code(GSoC) is a prestigious global program which aims to bring more student developers into open source software development. This program is for 3 months during the summers.  
In order to improve my software development skills and to get myself famialirised with open source software development, I applied for GSoC 2019 with two organisations - **Biomedical Informatics, Emory University** and **Ruby Science Foundation**. Thankfully, I was selected for GSoC 2019 with Ruby Science Foundation to work on the plotting library Rubyplot. This is the first of many blogs which I will be writing for my project. This first blog is an introduction to Rubyplot, my project and what to expect at the end of GSoC 2019. Stay tuned for more blogs :)
