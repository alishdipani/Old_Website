In the project introduction blog a scatter plot example was given, I will be explaining the technical details for that example which involves explaining the code for the library using **Magick backend**.
  
The example code : 
```ruby
require 'Rubyplot'
@xdata = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # Defining X data
@ydata = [11, 2, 33, 4, 65] # Defining Y data
@figure = Rubyplot::Figure.new # Creating the canvas
axes = @figure.add_subplot! 0,0 # Adding a subplot (0,0 as only one subplot is to be plotted)
axes.scatter! do |p| # Setting scatter as the type of subplot
  p.data @x1, @y1 # setting data to be plotted
  p.label = "data1" # defining label for the data
  p.marker_fill_color = :blue # defining colour of the markers
  p.marker_type = :circle # defining marker type
end
axes.title = "Nice plot" # defining title of the plot
axes.x_title = "X data" # defining title of X axis
axes.y_title = "Y data" # defining title of Y axis
@figure.write("scatterplot.png") # Drawing the figure and saving it
```
  
The output using Magick backend is:

# Code Explanation

So to go through the code let's start with the first 3 lines
```ruby
require 'Rubyplot'
@xdata = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # Defining X data
@ydata = [11, 2, 33, 4, 65] # Defining Y data
```
First Rubyplot is included which is similar to import in Python, this allows us to use Rubyplot.  Next we define 2 arrays xdata and ydata which store the X and Y coordinates to be plotted.  
## Figure
After this we create a new Figure object which will act as the canvas on which image will be drawn.
```ruby
@figure = Rubyplot::Figure.new # Creating the canvas
```
Creating a figure object calls the constructor of the figure class.
```ruby
def initialize(height: nil, width: nil, figsize_unit: :cm)
    super(0, 0)
    @title = ''
    @nrows = 1
    @ncols = 1
    @width = (width || DEFAULT_CANVAS_DIM).to_f
    @height = (height || DEFAULT_CANVAS_DIM).to_f
    @top_spacing = 5
    @bottom_spacing = 5
    @left_spacing = 5
    @right_spacing = 5
    @subplots = nil
    @figsize_unit = figsize_unit
    set_rubyplot_artist_coords!
    setup_default_theme
    add_subplots! @nrows, @ncols
end
```
Here, *height* and *width* represent the height and width of the canvas to be made respectively. *figsize_unit* is for saving the unit for measurement which are pixel, centimeter or inch.  
Now,
